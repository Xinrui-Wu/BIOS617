## Simple random sampling (SRS) without replacement

- Generate sample by sampling without replacement
- Given we selected $j$ *unique* units, the next unit is sampled uniformly at random with probability $1/(N-j)$.
- There are ${N \choose n} = N! / (n! (N-n)!)$ possible samples
- Sample mean under SRS is unbiased, with variance $(1-f) \frac{S^2}{n}$ 

## Unbiasedness of SRS sample mean

- What is the probability of sampling individual $j$?
$$\small
\begin{align*}
P(I_j = 1) &= 1 - P(I_j \neq 1) = 1 - \frac{N-1}{N} \times \frac{N-2}{N-1} \times \cdots \times \frac{N-n}{N-(n-1)}\\
&= 1 - \frac{N-n}{N} = \frac{n}{N}
\end{align*}
$$
-Then by linearity of expectations
$$\small
E [ \bar y ] = E [ \frac{1}{n} \sum_j I_j Y_j ] = \frac{1}{n} E [ \sum_j I_j  ]
$$
